# Mini-LISP-Interpreter

# Overview
LISP is an ancient programming language based on S-expressions and lambda calculus.
All operations in Mini-LISP are written in parenthesized prefix notation. For example, a
simple mathematical formula “(1 + 2) * 3” written in Mini-LISP is:
##(* (+ 1 2) 3)
As a simplified language, Mini-LISP has only three types (Boolean, number and function)
and a few operations.
